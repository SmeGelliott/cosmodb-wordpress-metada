## Create Cosmos DB to Hold Information about Uploaded Media Files

While Cosmos DB doesn't directly integrate with WordPress, you can leverage it to store additional metadata related to media files. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

1. **Create a Cosmos DB Account:**
   - Head over to the Azure portal and create a Cosmos DB account.

2. **Define a Container:**
   - Utilize the Cosmos DB SQL API to define a container specifically designed for storing media file metadata.

3. **Develop Custom PHP Code:**
   - Write custom PHP code within your WordPress installation to interact with the Cosmos DB API. This code will facilitate storing metadata alongside uploaded media files.
